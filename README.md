# Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website! This repository contains the code for my personal website, where I showcase my skills, projects, and interests.

## About Me

As a Computer Science Engineering student, I am deeply passionate about coding, with a specialization in full-stack Web development. My expertise lies in utilizing the MERN stack, complemented by Next.js, to craft dynamic and responsive websites that seamlessly integrate functionality and aesthetics.

Beyond the realm of coding, I find solace in delving into topics of geopolitics and Indian history, enriching my understanding of the world around me. In my leisure time, I indulge in the culinary arts, finding joy in experimenting with different cuisines. And when seeking a thrilling escape, I immerse myself in the world of horror movies. Through this diverse blend of interests and skills, I continually seek to expand my knowledge and contribute to innovative projects within the tech industry.
